Whatever Marvin likes in his Rails apps is here.

To configure:
1. rails g rename:app_to "whatever"
2. edit config/database.yml
3. add your Facebook app credentials to config/initializers/omniauth.rb and app/assets/javascripts/facebook.js.coffee

Works in any unix environment. If on Windows, the gemfile contains instructions on what to comment or uncomment. Don't have any of the necessary software? Use vagrant.
